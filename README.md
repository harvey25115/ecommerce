## Overview

This is a simple e-commerce app using NextJS.
I used Redux toolkit to make the currency settings persistent.
I did not used any UI library to showcase my skills in raw CSS but I used SASS to have a clean CSS code.
I decided to use SWR to get the currency data from API and save it to store.

# API used

- https://fakestoreapi.com
- https://api.apilayer.com/exchangerates_data

Since the currency API has limits on API call due to free account. I decided to turn off the auto-revalidation in SWR to minimize the API calls. I also added dummy data that is currently commented and
can be used if ever the limit usage to the currency API has reached its limit.

# Tech Stack

- NextJS
- Redux Toolkit
- Typescript
- SWR (for getting data in client-side with caching)
- SCSS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
